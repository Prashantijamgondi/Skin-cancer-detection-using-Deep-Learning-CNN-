# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

# Used Skin Cancer Types
1) Melanoma (MEL)
2) Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
3) Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
4) Dermatofibroma (DF)
# Used Aditional Types
5) Unknown Skin Cancer
6) Normal Skin cancer.

# Used Technologies
## Model Architecture:
### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
1) Best suited for image classification tasks
2) Layers: Conv2D > MaxPooling > Dropout > Flatten > Dense
### Transfer Learning Models:
1) ResNet
2) Improves accuracy & reduces training time
### Deep Learning Framework:
1) Tensorflow- High-level neural networks

## Used Dataset
1) ISIC dataset
2) Custom Images

## Frontend:
1) Reactjs
2) ExpressJs

## Backend:
1) Python
2) FastAPI

## Spaces

### To Start Frontend Go to frontend, Download Dependancies  `npm install` then run the site as `npm start` or `npm run build`
### To Start Backend Go to Backend, To run the site as `python main.py` 
### Achieved high Accuracy 88.8% from ISIC dataset
### By Uploading Image we can say if it is a cancer type or not
